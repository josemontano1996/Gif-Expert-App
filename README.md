Hello World, this is my first React proyect.

In this proyect I learned some core functionalities about React and created a Gifs searching App.

For this React proyect I used yarn as a package manager, Vite as building tool and Jest and testing-library/react for testing.

The link for visiting this proyect is the following: [GifsAppLink](https://josemontano1996.github.io/Gif-Expert-App/)

I am aware of the API key leak in the .env in some commits, this happened because I knew that I didnt want this keys to be secret so I didnt include it in the .gitignore.
